# Jagruti (HackStack'22)

### A mobile application to reduce food wastage and feed the people who go to sleep on empty stomach every day. And allowing people to post about the ongoing public events or to initiate an event where interested people can participate. ðŸ˜‡

  
  

Food security lies in the top *5 global issues*. Over **20 crore Indians** go to sleep empty-stomach every day. **FAO 2019** Report reveals that around ***14.5% of the Indian population*** falls beneath the underfed category. On the other hand, the amount of food wasted in India is estimated to be **68,760,163 tonnes a year**. According to a study majority of the food gets wasted by restaurants or religious functions.

India has around **31 lakh NGOs**, more than double the number of schools. We are building a mobile application that connects the two vital sectors in reducing food wastage as well as feeding the citizens. The nearest NGOs receive an instant notification whenever anyone updates on food availability. People can even conduct public events and post them on the application asking interested people to participate.*emphasized text*
